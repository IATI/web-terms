Data Removal
============

This guidance describes how IATI Reporting Organisations should remove data published to the IATI Standard and how anyone can make a Take Down Request to the IATI Secretariat.

Data Removal Process
====================

Data should be removed by unpublishing it from your IATI publication. If you remove a complete dataset the `IATI Registry <https://iatiregistry.org/>`_ must be updated.

The IATI Registry does not store any IATI data, but it does provide links to places where the data can be downloaded.

Removing activities from your IATI publication
----------------------------------------------

How you do this will depend on your publishing method. There are instructions for removing activities from `IATI Publisher
<https://docs.publisher.iatistandard.org/en/latest/publish-activity/#unpublishing-activity-data>`_ and `AidStream
<https://aidstream.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405999519769-Unpublish-Activity>`_. 

If you use one of the `other IATI publishing tools <https://iatistandard.org/en/guidance/publishing-data/how-to-publish-data/publishing-tools-and-services-to-create-your-iati-data-files/>`_, contact their support for help with removing individual activities.

Updating the IATI Registry
--------------------------

If you have removed a complete dataset or datasets you should also make sure the IATI Registry is updated. Some publishing tools, such as AidStream and IATI Publisher will automatically do this for you.

Login to an administrator account for your organisation, select 'Manage' and then go to the 'Datasets' tab. If present, select the dataset you have removed.

You have two options:

*Make the dataset ‘Private’*

You might consider this if you intend to republish the dataset after a review. 

*Delete the dataset*

You might consider this if the removal is permanent.

What happens when IATI data is removed
======================================

Applications use and store data published to the IATI Standard. These are known as ‘consuming applications’ and each should have its own data removal guidance. Not all of these applications are designed and managed by the IATI Secretariat.

Consuming applications managed by IATI Secretariat
--------------------------------------------------

IATI-managed tools will refresh in the following specified time frames, with the data removed accordingly:

* `IATI Datastore <https://iatidatastore.iatistandard.org/>`_ - refreshes every 24 hours
* `IATI Validator <https://iativalidator.iatistandard.org/>`_ - refreshes every 2 hours
* `IATI Dashboard <http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/>`_ and `IATI Publishing Statistics <http://publishingstats.iatistandard.org/>`_ - refreshes every 24 hours
* `D-portal <http://d-portal.org/ctrack.html#view=search>`_ - refreshes every 24 hours

You should confirm the data is no longer available on the Registry, and in consuming applications after 24-36 hours.

External consuming applications not managed by IATI
---------------------------------------------------

As an open data standard, IATI data is available for use by anyone wishing to build a consuming application that uses IATI data. If someone decides to remove their data from the IATI Registry, they should contact the external tool provider to check their data removal policy and refresh times.

Asking for data to be removed
=============================

Asking a publisher directly
---------------------------

If a user becomes aware of IATI data that they feel should not be shared openly, they should contact the publishing organisation directly to request that the data be removed. The person making the request should refer to the contact information provided in the profile of the publisher in the Registry, and should state:

* their role and relationship to the data;
* the specific data they are requesting be removed;
* the reason for the request.

Making a take down request to the IATI Secretariat
--------------------------------------------------

A request to take down data can be made by anyone.

Publishers can make a take down request if:

- they are unable to follow the Data Removal Process, or
- the data removal is urgent

The request can be made by `contacting the IATI Secretariat </en/guidance/get-support/>`_.

The person making the request should state:

* their role and relationship to the data;
* the specific data they are requesting be removed;
* the reason for the request.

The take down request process
-----------------------------

Requests from reporting organisations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the request is from the organisation that owns the data and it is clear what information is to be removed, we will work with the organisation to remove it from both their IATI publication and the Registry, if necessary.

Requests from third parties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the request is not from the Reporting Organisation, we will consider the reason for the request. For example, it may contain sensitive personal information or be inaccurate.

Sometimes we can act without prior consent of the data Reporting Organisation. On other occasions the Reporting Organisation needs to be involved in any decision.

Once we decide whether to take action, the person who made the request will be informed. If we decide that data should be removed from IATI consuming applications, we will act as quickly as possible. We may need to work with the requester to identify all the relevant data.

We will also work with the Reporting Organisation to ensure that they are able to remove/redact the data at source. If data is published using AidStream or IATI Publisher we may also remove the data from a reporting organisation's publication ourselves.

Exceptionally, we might need to clear all of an organisation's IATI data. We will only do this when this is the only course of action available, given the circumstances of the request.

We understand that any request to remove data will be seen as urgent by the person making the request. We will inform the requester of our actions and the expected time frame for taking down any relevant data.

Contacting IATI Support
